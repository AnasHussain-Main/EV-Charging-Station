# EV Charging Station Locator

# Project Overview
The EV Charging Station Locator is an advanced routing system designed to enhance the electric vehicle (EV) driving experience by providing efficient navigation to the nearest charging stations. Utilizing graph theory and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, this project offers a reliable solution for EV drivers to find optimal routes within a network, ensuring accessibility and convenience in locating charging infrastructure.

# Key Features
**Graph-Based Network Representation:** Models the road network and charging stations as a weighted graph, where nodes represent intersections or points of interest, and edges depict the roadways connecting them.

**Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm:** Efficiently computes the shortest path to the nearest charging station from any given location within the network.

**Dynamic Routing Recommendations:** Offers real-time route optimization based on the current location, providing the most efficient path to the closest charging station.

**Scalable Infrastructure:** Designed to accommodate expanding networks, allowing for the integration of new charging stations and roadways as the EV market grows.

# Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python

**Data Structures:** Graphs, Priority Queues

**Algorithms:** Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm

# Use Case
Ideal for EV drivers seeking the most efficient route to charging stations, urban planners optimizing EV infrastructure, and developers integrating EV navigation solutions into broader transportation or mapping applications.

# How to Use
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the main script to initiate the route recommendation process. Input the current location node, and the system will provide the nearest charging station and the optimal route.
